# Flutter_Basics


-> FLUTTER


-Flutter was launched by Google and is an open-source mobile application development SDK.
-It is a popular cross-platform app development and is written in the Dart language. (It allows the programmer to develop applications for both android and iOS platforms , using a single code base)
-Best suited for the development of the hybrid apps.
-It makes use of the 2D rendering engine called Skia to develop the visuals.



-> How does Flutter work ??


-Flutter code is compiled directly into Native arm code , for the respective platform. So for iOS it will compile into Swift code and similarly , for android , it compiles to Java or Kotlin arm code. Now since this code conversion takes place during runtime , the application thus produced is no different from a native mobile application.


-> What’s special about that...We can use any
   cross platform network if we want, why
   not something else ?


Some of the outstanding traits Flutter has that makes it stand out :
1. React native , which is , FYI , The most widely used cross platform framework , and some people are just crazy about , uses something called a “JavaScript Bridge” to fill the “Gap” between a Web app and Mobile app. Although this provides cross-platform compatibility , this also hinders the performance of the application , making it less useful whenever one needs to develop a sophisticated app. On the other hand , Flutter simply compiles the code into a native snippet , so Bye-bye to JavaScript Bridge .
2. And what about Xamarin ? Xamarin makes use of C# and .NET framework , to achieve cross - platform compatibility. How do these register as limitations?? Firstly , the learning curve for .NET and C# is quite steep so fast development is a long shot . Secondly , .NET is a paid service at enterprise level. That just negates the idea of freedom !



-> Some Advantages that Flutter offer over
   the other Technologies in Race... ... ... !
  

1. No JavaScript Bridge as Flutter compiles to actual native code and is rendered using SKIA Graphics Engine which was initially developed by SKIA Inc. and later acquired by Google.
2. Less Compile time. The most common challenge that every mobile app developer faces is the exceedingly long compilation time of the native code , which in case of iOS just becomes insane. Flutter offers instant and on-the-fly compilation capabilities. So a developer can now compile a mobile application code in less than 30 seconds.
3. Hot Reload is another cool feature provided by flutter , it allows a developer to perform incremental compilation in a matter of milliseconds.
*Incremental compilation ??.......imagine a scenario where we compile our code once, and then we change something in our code. Now to see the output we simply save our file and perform a Hot Reload, it will reflect the change in no time.
4. Flutter also provides a huge array of animations including custom animations to choose from.
5. Dart is quite similar to javaScript.




-> Some large Scale Organisations that
   incorporated Flutter in their own
   Applications. . . . .


1. Alibaba
2. OfflinePal
3. Apptree
4. Birch Finance
5. Topline
6. Reflectly



-> Flutter is the Next Big Thing............Why ???


1. It’s powered by Google.
2. It definitely beats its rivals on the performance front , and gives it’s users a Nice
and Smooth UI experience.
3. It’s the base for Google’s FUCHSIA OS, which is a well esteemed project by
google, to complete with Mac and Windows OS.
